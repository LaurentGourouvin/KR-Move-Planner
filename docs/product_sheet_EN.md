# 🇰🇷 KR-Move Planner — Product Sheet
### _AI-powered Relocation Dashboard for Future South Korea Expats_

---

## 📌 Overview

**KR-Move Planner** is an AI-assisted relocation dashboard designed for professionals preparing to move to **South Korea under the E-7 work visa**.

The platform generates a **personalized relocation strategy**, organizes every required step, and tracks the entire journey — from early planning to job offer and departure.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Relocating to South Korea is a difficult and fragmented process:

- information scattered across many websites,  
- unclear documentation requirements,  
- complex E-7 eligibility rules,  
- no centralized tracking for tasks or job applications,  
- high stress and confusion for candidates.

Most people rely on spreadsheets, random notes, and guesswork — which leads to mistakes and delays.

- AI-generated **relocation plan** tailored to each user,  
- step-by-step **task list**,  
- visual **progress timeline**,  
- **job applications tracker**,  
- final **Expat Card** when everything is complete.

It turns a stressful administrative challenge into a clear, organized roadmap.
