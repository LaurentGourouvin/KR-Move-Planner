## 🌏 What is KR-Move Planner?

**KR-Move Planner** is a personal **relocation & visa planning dashboard** designed for people preparing to move to **South Korea** (E-7 visa track, work visas, or long-term stay).

It combines:

- AI-powered **visa / relocation strategy generation**  
- automatically generated **task list** based on user profile  
- a progress-based **timeline** for the full relocation  
- a **job applications tracker**  
- a final **“Expat Card”** when everything is completed  

The goal is to provide a **clear roadmap**, reduce uncertainty, and centralize everything someone needs when preparing an international relocation.

This is a **non-commercial**, **open-source**, **MIT-licensed** project built for learning, portfolio, and real-world use.

## ✨ Features

### ✔ Available / Implemented

- **Access Request System**  
  Users must request access (pseudo, company, position, hiring intent) before creating an account.  
  This limits AI usage and prevents unwanted billing.

- **Admin Panel**  
  Admin can approve or reject access requests.  
  Approval automatically creates a user account and sends login instructions.

- **User Onboarding Profile**  
  At first login, users complete their relocation profile:  
  first name, age, nationality, salary (€), years of experience, degree, job role.

- **AI-Generated Relocation Strategy**  
  A personalized strategy is generated from the user profile (HTML/Markdown).  
  Stored in database and displayed on dashboard.

- **AI-Generated Task List (Checklist)**  
  The AI returns a structured JSON list (documents, job search, Korean, admin tasks).  
  Items are saved as tasks linked to the user.

- **Dashboard Layout**  
  Clean layout showing the strategy + a tasks sidebar.

---

### 🚧 In Progress

- **Task Progression System**  
  Status management: `TODO / IN_PROGRESS / DONE`.

- **Timeline Based on Progress**  
  Dynamic timeline showing the user’s relocation progress in %.

- **Job Applications Tracker**  
  CRUD for: company, position, contact, date, status, notes.

- **Expat Card Generation**  
  Auto-generation when tasks = 100% and user has been hired.

- **Admin User Management UI**  
  Approve, delete, reset passwords.

---

### 🚀 Planned

- **Multi-language Support (EN/KR)**  
  Internationalize all UI text and pages.

- **Budget Planner**  
  With optional AI-generated financial advice (safe, simple, non-legal).

- **Strategy Regeneration Limits**  
  Limit AI usage per user (e.g., 3 regenerations max).

- **Token Usage Logging & Monitoring**  
  To control billing and detect abuse.

- **Improved AI Prompts + JSON Schemas**  
  Better structure for tasks, deadlines, categories.

- **Export Strategy to PDF**  
  One-click export via backend.

- **Notifications / Reminders**

## 💡 Vision

KR-Move Planner aims to be:

- a **real-world fullstack project**  
- a **clean architecture example** (frontend + API + DB + AI)  
- a **practical relocation dashboard** for future expatriates  
- a **serious portfolio piece** aligned with my goal of working in South Korea  
- an experiment in **cost-controlled AI integration**  
- a demonstration of **problem-solving, UX thinking, and product design**  

The project represents both **technical ambition** and my **personal E-7 visa journey** — building the exact tool I wish existed when preparing to relocate.
